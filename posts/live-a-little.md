# Live a Little

Coming soon...


should have thoughts on living life intensely in the pursuit of something

should also include power of one thoughts (push through for one more, and be the one person to do it as a guiding light)

hunt challenges / experiences / feedback 

civilization is guided by the few 

strong enough to feed others 

should also include information abuot honing your instincts 

should also talk about the hedonistic heuristic 

also what this means looking ahead to your year at NYC
