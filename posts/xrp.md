# How it started

In highschool, all I did was competitive robotics. I first started in 8th grade on a small team and immediately got hooked. Not on robotics per se, but the idea of winning the FRC World Championship (Worlds). It immediately (and irrationaly) became the only thing I cared about in highschool. My relationships with my family and friends, any intellectual curiosity, as well as my health had begun to deteriorate. 

If you can't tell, I'm not proud of this. In the moment, it was cool to just focus on the one thing that I found worth dying for (I'm not sure if this is hyperbole since I was essentially killing myself towards this goal). Then in my junior year summer, I had a chance to take a step back and realize some things: 

* I was proud of myself for trying 
* I wanted to share this deep sense of ambition with other people, not just keep it for myself 
* I still really wanted to win Worlds (glad to say I overacheived on this one)

I'm glad to say I toned it back a bit, but I now knew that I wanted more people to also feel like they could take on the world. My early attempt at sharing my beliefs on leadership and passion was a book I wrote over the summer while the thoughts were still raw. While I still agree with the content, I've come to disagree with the medium. Self-help books aren't the path towards creating real change, you need to convince people that changing is worth it, something I would argue you can only do by empowering them to get their hands dirty. 

# How its going 

I left this thesis untouched for a couple years until I got to Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) as an undergrad. All undergrads at WPI are required to complete an Interactive Qualifying Project (IQP), essentially a public service project that most students do abroad in a different country. I instead chose to stay on-campus to do my IQP on the Experiential Robotics Platform (XRP). 

Their thesis sounded eerily similar: let students at a young age build experience solving hard problems (robotics challenges) as a means of building interest in STEM. Over my freshman summer I helped write the first set of curriculum, a task that started out feeling laborous but I eventually developed an appreciation for the skill of distilling the complexity of a robotics concept (something like proportional control) to something that a middle school student can understand and appreciate. 

We then refined the curriculum enough to be ready for launch. Hundreds of man hours put into integrating national standards, iterating with feedback from teachers, and tedisouly working through the examples ourselves to make sure they worked all went into the launch. The launch however, inspired less confidence in teachers than we had hoped. We failed to account for the fact that whiel students might be comfortable reading through the documentaiton, teachers sho are already overworked across the world (and often don't have a robotics background) wouldn't have the bandwidth to teach tehmselves the content and be confident enough to teach a couple dozen, inquitize students the next day. 

So, we got to work on teh next stage of deployment: a context aware AI chatbot. I won't bore you with the technical details, it's all open source and you can message me with any questions you have about the deployment and automated eval architecture. I just wanted to mention this all since XRP is a project I really believe in. More than anything, I want to solve the culture problem implicit in the existing education problem. Currently, it's "corny" to care about something or be genuine in your actions. It's arrogant to think that you can change the world for the better. Someohow, it's stupid to think you can do something spectacular if you haven't already done so, imagine if the job requirements for curing cancer were that you had to have cured cancer before. 

That's why I care, because I want other people to care too.
