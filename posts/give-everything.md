## Strong Enough to Feed Others 

"Before you take your first bite, offer some to everyone else at the table". It was such a simple rule, constantly drilled into me from a young age by my parents. Now, it's funny to see how it's become a part of who I am: sharing what I have gives me an inexplicable feeling of warmth that I can only describe as "meaning". This (and generally my restless nature) is why my dream job looks something like an open-source version of Google X's Rapid Evaluator role. I want to build and share proof-of-concepts to solve the world's hardest problems. Effectively, I'd like to dedicate my life to democratizing state-of-the-art (SOTA) technology for the betterment of others. 

To do this however, I have to first earn technical and financial and meritocratic freedom. Freedom itself is not a right, instead, the ability to pursue freedom is; I believe freedom is earned through ability and merit. So, I can reframe my current goals to be building the technical skills, financial base, and "resume" that earns people's trust. I've chosen to further simplify this by naively focusing on solving hard problems that I care about, the idea being that challenging problems will refine my technical skills and that I don't just "care" about something in a vaccum. If I care, then I assume others do too, meaning they are willing to compensate and respect those that can solve these problems. 

## Frameworks 

Like this, I tend to boil down most things in my life to "frameworks", simple rules that I can live by and hone into instincts. When applied correctly, frameworks have been a powerful tool in alleviating the analysis paralysis that I struggle with. The framework I previously mentioned is something I've coined the "hedonistic hunt". 

Hedonism gets a bad rep from the "pleasure junkies" of the past, those who would be gladly swallowed by gluttony. Instead, I like to reframe hedonism from "what do I want" to "what do I want to see more of in the world". One "happy accident" with this paradigm shift is that what you want to see as valuable to the world often intersects with what others are willing to pay for, meaning you can productize the things you want to work on. Furthermore, I think by working on projects you think matter, you become someone that you think matters. It's not just about the things you've worked on, it's the laughs you share with the people you meet, the memories you will remember fondly, and the internal narrative you build about yourself.

As for the "hunt" aspect, that helps explain two other successful attributes of this framework. Hunting means that at some point you'll get hungry again. Because you are working on problems you think matter, there will always be another one around the corner. It's kind of like the most satisfying version of whack-a-mole but in this case, you get to keep all of the rewards from whacking a mole before another one pops up. 

Hunting also forces you to catch one thing at a time. you can't get distracted hunting multiple things, because if they are worth hunting, they will require everything that you have. This also helps someone like me who often gets distracted by the next shiny thing to work on so this is a skill / paradigm that I am actively honing. 

## Simplifying Further

I've built up many others throughout the years which I've distilled into the following soundbytes: 

* 84,600 daily budget: you have a finite amount of time, make sure you use every second 
* 30 failures away from success: you never know when you'll strike gold, so keep digging 
* Pray for stronger legs, not easier roads: work for the strength to be kind 
* The dancing are insane to the deaf: not everyone will understand, don't stop dancing
* Be confident in chaos, not comfortable in illusion: learn to dance in a raging storm  
* Embrace extremities: train like an athlete, study like a scholar, love like an artist 
* Naivete can defy the impossible: sometimes it just takes someone to try 
* Show don’t tell, listen don’t lecture, question don’t accept 
* Only do things you get energy from: don't lose yourself in the process
* Be the activation energy: you can't change others, only show them what's possible 
* Chase divinity, practice humanity: be unconditionally kind to others on your path
* Individualism for the collective: build yourself for the collective 

But even this list is vague and context-specific. I've further compressed the frameworks into three main attributes: competence, kindness, and conviction. Being competent allows you to happen to the world, being kind makes the world a better place, and having conviction in your path brings all of this to fruition. I truly believe that if all of us were a little more competent, kind, and convicted, the world would be a better place. And like one of my frameworks reminds me, I know I can't change others, I can only show them what's possible by working to master these three attributes in my own life. 

## Editor's Note 

All this sounds nice, but who cares about the philisophical takes of a 20 year old? And, why does he feel obligated to make this post? 

Today is the day I've chosen to drop out of my masters program at Cornell and go full-time with Distyl. If enabling others through democratizing technology is what I claim to care about, then continuing my education seems misaligned with my frameworks when compared to running after this opportunity. Time will tell if this IS the right decision, but for the time being, it FEELS like the right decision and that's enough for me. And, I wanted to articulate these thoughts in case it helps anyone else who is also choosing between pursuing education or themselves. 

Also, for what it's worth. I haven't "won" yet (whatever that means). I had a similar experience in high school where I had thoughts about leadership and I published a book about it on KDP. Using these guiding principles, I then went on to lead my robotics team to win both the FIRST and VEX World Championships in 2022. I'm grateful that I chose to write my thoughts on leadership in the moment as opposed to hindsight; it gave me a chance to reflect on exactly what I was thinking instead of forcing me to approximate it through rose-colored glasses. And I hope this post serves a similar purpose, where I can reflect on eaxctly what I was thinking and give others a chance to do the same.

If you're curious about the book, here is a link to the [PDF](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1v5LmUavplXsv35eouWZea2w_r9n3_Lbk/view?usp=sharing). Admittedly, the title and content of the book makes me cringe when I read it now, but I guess that's just how growth feels.
