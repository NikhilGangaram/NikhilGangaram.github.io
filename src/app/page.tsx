            <p>
              Hey there, I&lsquo;m Nikhil! I&lsquo;m a roboticist and computer scientist currently pursuing my Master of Engineering at Cornell Tech after spending my undergraduate years at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI).
            </p>

            <p>
              I started working on robots at Team 254 (The Cheesy Poofs), where I ended my senior year as Team President and helped contribute to the team&lsquo;s dual World Championship victories in both FRC and VRC.
            </p>

            <p>
              In my undergrad, I primarily focused on research and have had the pleasure of working on projects ranging from bipedal robots, to model rockets, to drone swarms (for humanitarian aid), to vision systems for plants, and even machine learning based atomic simulations in Japan. I&lsquo;ve written of some of these projects {' '}

            <p>
              When I&lsquo;m not building, I&lsquo;m usually thinking about the future of AI education, contributing to open-source projects, or getting lost in a new book.
