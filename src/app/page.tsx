            <h3>About Me</h3>
            
            <p>
              Hey there, I&apos;m Nikhil! I&apos;m currently studying swarm robotics and computational complexity theory at WPI. 
              Beyond that, I&apos;m exploring how I can integrate Generative AI with robotics education to make learning 
              more accessible and engaging for students worldwide.
            </p>

            <p>
              I&apos;ve had the privilege of working across various domains in robotics and AI. At MIT Lincoln Laboratory, 
              I worked as a Research Intern focusing on advanced perception systems. At Untill, I developed computer 
              vision solutions for real-world applications. I&apos;m also actively involved in research at the NEST Lab, 
              where I contribute to cutting-edge work in swarm robotics and multi-agent systems.
            </p>

            <p>
              My journey in robotics began early through my involvement with Team 254 (The Cheesy Poofs), where I 
              served as Team President. This experience taught me the importance of collaboration, innovation, and 
              practical problem-solving in robotics. It&apos;s where I first fell in love with the intersection of 
              hardware and software in creating intelligent systems.
            </p>

            <p>
              Currently, I&apos;m working on several exciting projects including HURON (legged robotics), XRP 
              (Experiential Robotics Platform for education), and various research initiatives through WPI&apos;s 
              High-Powered Rocket Competition team. Each project teaches me something new about the challenges 
              and opportunities in bringing robots into the real world.
            </p>

            <p>
              I obtained my degree in Robotics Engineering and Computer Science from Worcester Polytechnic Institute, 
              where I&apos;ve been fortunate to work with incredible faculty and fellow researchers. I&apos;ve also had the 
              opportunity to collaborate internationally as a Visiting Researcher at KUAS (Kyoto University of 
              Advanced Science), which broadened my perspective on global approaches to robotics research.
            </p>

            <p>
              When I&apos;m not working on robots, you can find me thinking about the future of AI education, contributing 
              to open-source robotics projects, or exploring how we can make advanced robotics more accessible to 
              the next generation of engineers and researchers.
            </p>
